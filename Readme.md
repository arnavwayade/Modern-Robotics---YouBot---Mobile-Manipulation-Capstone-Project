# Modern-Robotics---YouBot---Mobile-Manipulation-Capstone-Project
 This repo describes the mobile manipulation caption project from the book - Modern Robotics. The objective of this project is to build a software that plans a trajectory for the end-effector of the youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down.
